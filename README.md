### Sari data


this is the updated code, in the code there is a u vs y lot of all the x values, in addition to that i cell 9 you can choose theta_target between 0 and lambda and you will get a  4 plot with all the x values that fall in that phase, two plots are u vs y and the other two are v vs y, the difference between the two plots that have similar variable plotted against y (u or v) is that one code gets the x values on the nodes closest to the x value of the phase and the other does a linear interpolation to get the value in the exact x. and finally the is a stats pressure vs x plot of the nodes on the lower wall with the stagnation points marked.

The files that I sent you before are all with wall wave amplitude a=0.05m and wavelength (lambda)= pi/8.
